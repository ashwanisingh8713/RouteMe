Reference Terminologies ############
Trackable: A Trackable is an interface which can be followed by ARCore and something from which Anchors can be connected to.

Anchor:  It describes a fixed location and orientation in the real world. To stay at a fixed location in physical space,
the numerical description of this position will update as ARCore’s understanding of the space improves. Anchors are hashable
and may for example be used as keys in HashMaps.

Pose: At the point when you need to state wherein the scene you need to put the object and you need to specify the location
in terms of the scene’s coordinates. The Pose is the means by which you state this.

Session: Deals with the AR framework state and handles the session lifecycle. This class offers the primary passage to the
ARCore API. This class permits the user to make a session, configure it, start or stop it and, above all, receive frames
that allow access to the camera image and device pose.

Textures: Textures are especially helpful for Augmented Faces. This permits you to make a light overlay that lines up with
the locales of the identified face(s) to add to your experience.

ArFragment: ARCore utilizes an ArFragment that provides a lot of features, for example, plane finding,
permission handling, and camera set up. You can utilize the fragment legitimately in your activity, however at
whatever point you need custom features, for example, Augmented Faces, you should extend the ArFragment and set
the proper settings. This fragment is the layer that conceals all the compound stuff (like OpenGL, rendering models, etc)
and gives high-level APIs to load and render 3D models.

ModelRenderable: ModelRenderable renders a 3D Model by attaching it to a Node.

Sceneform SDK: Sceneform SDK is another library for Android that empowers the quick creation and mix of AR
experiences in your application. It joins ARCore and an amazing physically-based 3D renderer.
