1. First Need to get Camera Position
2. Get Distance between Camera and First coordinate of Server.
3. Find the direction of Next coordinate with respect to Camera's coordinate
4. Make next coordinates in Plane using Distance.

on each frame,
    1. Camera's distance should be calculated with next coordinates
    2. If next coordinate is straight it should show
    3. If next coordinate is positioning at left/right direction it should now be shown until distance is less than 1 meter.



if(x1==x2 && y1==y2 && z1 != z2) {
    if(z1>z2) {
        // Moving backward
    }
    else if(z2>z1) {
        // Moving forward
    }
}
