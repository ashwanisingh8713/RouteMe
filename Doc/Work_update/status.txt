    There is some issue with removing surface graph I am working on this.
    Currently I am able to calculate and get
        - Distance of start Anchor to end Anchor and distance between sequential two Anchor.
        - Distance of camera with respect to start Anchor.
        - Angle between three Anchors.
        - Direction calculation between sequential two Anchor.
    Here Today my brother and me were trying to make more path but Maker app is throwing error.
    relevant error video is also attached.
    I request to kindly fix Maker app issue.
    Next I will work to fix, "acnchor points empty" issue.
    And next I will move on:
        - ARPath screen, with live data and distance & duration update.
        - Angle mapping for upcoming Anchor.  (I will check iOS & take assistance from my brother)
        - Direction mapping for upcoming Anchor. (I will check iOS & take assistance from my brother) (edited)

    Status is below:
        - Added user & path info UI on top of AR screen.
        - On Camera move moving avatar icon on Ruler Img.
    still I am using mock data.

    Currently you are using two separate barcodes.
        1st, To Launch Instant App
        2nd, To get the RouteList

    In next update we will make one barcode to Launch & get the RouteList.

    Kindly Find the attached barcode imgs.

    In previous status update only "distance" update is done.

    New Instant App build is published in Playstore, kindly use attached image "Android_InstantApp_Launch" to launch.
